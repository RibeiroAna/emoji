# Emoji to Words

## What it does

Screen readers often can't recognize emojis, so this Firefox-extension provides emoji substitution to words so visually impaired people can see what they mean. It is also useful for people who are not used to Emoji language and don't know the meaning of such things.

## How to install

Soon it will be available at Firefox extension Store, but meanwhile you can install it by following the steps bellow:

* Go to `about:debugging#addons` on your Firefox browser;
* Enable add-on debugging;
* Click the `Load Temporary Add-on` button and upload the file `manifest.json` to the browser;
